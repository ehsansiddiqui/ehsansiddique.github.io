                        Hello, I have completed my Masters in Data Science at
                        UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©, where my academic journey is deeply rooted in the
                        the ever-evolving field of Machine Learning and AI. I studied courses such as Advanced Data Science,
                        Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Robotics in my masters program.
                        I completed my thesis on detecting anomalies in human trajectories as a part of LISTE group at Ã‰cole d'ingÃ©nieurs
                        du numÃ©rique (ISEP). The objective was to compare unsupervised
                        approaches for anomaly detection and develop an efficient online detection method. I explored statistical, machine learning,
                        and deep learning approaches, including DBSCAN, Recurrent Neural Networks, and deep generative sequence modeling. I presented my findings at seminars at ISEP
                        and UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ© and published my work as a first author at the International Congress on Information and Communication
                        Technology in London.

                        I have completed my bachelors in Computer Science from Bahria University. I studied courses such as
                        Computer Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Applied Calculus, Probability and Statistics,
                        Artificial Intelligence, and Discrete Mathematics. These courses provided me with a strong foundation
                        in Computer Science, which was further enhanced by laboratory courses. In my thesis, I worked on the research and development of an
                        in-house collaboration platform for students and professors, integrated with recommendation systems. This platform is currently
                        in use at the university, aiding students in their research and final year projects.
